    "## Dynamic Programming\n",
    "Regardless of its name, the idea behind *Dynamic Programming (DP)* is pretty simple and emerging from the Divide and Conquer paradigm, and it is used efficiently in many **optimization problems**. As we mentioned in the previous lab, the Divide and Conquer tries to split the main problem into **smaller sub-problems** of the same type. Therefore, we mentioned a common properties of the problems that could be solved using Divide and Conquer:\n",
    "- The problem could be divided into smaller problems of the *same type*\n",
    "- We can solve these smaller problems at a particular level; otherwise, we would divide forever.\n",
    "- Given the solution of these smaller problems, we could combine them to provide the solution of the bigger problem\n",

    "### Problem\n",

    "$$\\boxed{MF(i) = e_i + \\min\\left(MF(i+1),MF(i+2)\\right)}$$\n",

    "2. $MF(1) \\ \\text{ needs }\\ MF(2) \\land MF(3)$\n",

    "Hence, we can see that $MF(2)$ will be computed twice. Therefore, there is indeed **repeated work**. We can even verify this empirically, by adjusting our function and calling it like below:"
